# Refactoring tech test

A recent tech test I completed, but got rejected for :(

Feedback:

+ Payment service is quite readable
- 50/50 regarding solid principles
- Added functionality in the Account.cs, used it as a Domain Object rather than keeping it as a poco / dto.
- We expect Senior Engineers to be able to refactor code without introducing side effects into the code
- There are a lot of tests, split in to separate files where one would do

Where did I go wrong?
